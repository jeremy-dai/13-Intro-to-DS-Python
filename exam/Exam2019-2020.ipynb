    "The Vigenère cipher is a method of encrypting alphabetic text, based on the letters of a keyword. First described by Giovan Battista Bellaso in 1553, the cipher is easy to understand and implement, but it resisted all attempts to break it until 1863, three centuries later. This earned it the description *le chiffre indéchiffrable* ('the indecipherable cipher').\n",
    "\n",
    "In the 19th century the scheme was misattributed to Blaise de Vigenère (1523–1596), and so acquired its present name.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Vigenère cipher is simple enough to be a field cipher if it is used in conjunction with cipher disks. The Confederate States of America, for example, used a brass cipher disk to implement the Vigenère cipher during the American Civil War. The Confederacy's messages were far from secret, and the Union regularly cracked its messages. Throughout the war, the Confederate leadership primarily relied upon three key phrases: \"Manchester Bluff\", \"Complete Victory\" and, as the war came to a close, \"Come Retribution\".\n",

    "\n",
    "First of all, in the Vigenère cipher, only letters can be represented, no spaces or symbols, and no distinction is made between smaller and upper case letters.  So the first thing we do is to convert the message (and the key as well) to lower case, and we remove everything that's not a letter. Then the key is extended by repetition to the same length as the message:\n",

    "Next, we identify each letter with its index in the alphabet, so we count `a`=0, `b`=1, and so forth. The Vigenère cryptogram is obtained by adding each letter of the message with each corresponding letter in the extended key. The addition is cyclic: for example, `z+c` would normally be 25+2=27, but since the alphabet is only 26 long, the result cycles back: 26 becomes 0, 27 becomes 1, and so on. So  `z+c=b`.
